  <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">Welcome! My name is <span class="name">Marvin Rusinek</span>. I am a Comp Sci and LIS graduate and I&apos;m currently seeking a Front-End Web Developer position. I am based in Brooklyn, New York and have significant experience with front-end development and user experience design. I am looking for full-time employment in a digital agency in Manhattan working with the Angular framework. I have been working with Angular for over 2 years. I attended the Angular Summit in Boston last year where I received full-day training in Angular and also attended the two-day symposium.</p>
  <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">My Bachelor&apos;s is in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.poly.edu" target="_blank">NYU Tandon School of Engineering &mdash; Polytechnic Institute</a> and my Master&apos;s is in Library and Information Science from <a href="http://sils.pratt.edu" title="Pratt Institute School of Information and Library Science" target="_blank">Pratt Institute</a>. I hold professional certificates in Advanced Web Development and .NET Application Development from <a href="http://sps.nyu.edu" title="New York University School of Professional Studies" target="_blank">NYU SPS</a>. During my studies at Poly, I took graduate courses in JAVA programming and software engineering. At my previous job as Processing Archivist at the <a href="http://www.ajhs.org">American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS)</a>, I created detailed archival finding aids and encoded them using the <abbr title="Encoded Archival Description">EAD</abbr> schema along with XML, a markup language similar to HTML in that it is a way of structuring metadata. At the AJHS, I solved archival problems creatively and efficiently. I was also webmaster of the AJHS website which I maintained for roughly seven years using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Drupal. During my last semester at Pratt, I decided to pursue web development more ardently and took on formalized training at NYU where I learned how to code with JavaScript/jQuery, AJAX, C#, ASP.NET WebForms and MVC along with Microsoft SQL Server and the Entity Framework.</p>
  <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">I am passionate about both learning and practicing web development. I am proficient with the development of static websites as well as e-commerce websites, database-driven web applications, and enterprise-level web applications. I can create pixel-perfect websites from wireframes and mockups and am skilled at making websites responsive for tablets and mobile devices. I love building websites that use JavaScript, especially with Angular. I am excited by using the latest technologies and am constantly learning and improving my programming and problem solving skills by building projects and completing code challenges. I take courses online from sites such as Coursera, Pluralsight and Udemy to enhance my skills. I maintain dedicated to learning web development by attending monthly programming meetups, annual programming conferences and code camps in the NYC area. My technical interests include reactive programming, software engineering, application security, artificial intelligence and neural-network computing. My interests outside of work include watching basketball and soccer, playing table tennis, running, working out, listening to music, photography and hanging out with my family.</p>
