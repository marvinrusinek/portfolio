          Hi! My name is <span class="name">Marvin Rusinek</span>. I am a Computer Science and Library and Information
          Sciences graduate. I have significant experience with front-end development and user experience design.  I am
          based in Brooklyn, NY and am currently seeking a full-time junior front-end web developer position ideally in
          a digital agency in New York City working with the latest version of the
          <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a> framework.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
          I have been working with Angular for over two years. I used the AngularJS (version 1.x) of the framework for
          nine months before switching over to Angular 2. In September 2017, I made the 12.5-hour trek by bus from
          Niagara Falls to Boston to attend the <a href="https://www.angularsummit.com" target="_blank">Angular
          Summit</a> in Boston which included a full-day training in Angular 4 and a two-day symposium. In November
          2017, I attended the Open Camps in Manhattan which featured an intensive Angular 5 training session and then
          covered all the major features of Angular, its place in the JavaScript ecosystem, libraries that can be used
          with Angular and much more. Since then I have been learning Angular on my own by developing this website, by
          taking online courses in JavaScript and Angular on Udemy, Pluralsight and Coursera, reading JavaScript and
          Angular books, following Google Developer Experts&apos; websites, researching on StackOverflow and Googling.
          I am currently using Angular 7 and enjoy learning about the latest features. I am an active joiner of the
          monthly <a href="https://www.angularnyc.com" target="_blank">AngularNYC meetup</a>,
          <a href="http://www.buzzjs.com" target="_blank">BuzzJS conferences</a> and the
          <a href="http://www.codecampnyc.org" target="_blank">Code Camp NYC</a> at Microsoft annually.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
          I am also very interested in software engineering and database design. I have taken graduate courses in Java
          programming with an emphasis on object-oriented software engineering practices. I also have completed
          coursework at NYU in C# with ASP.NET MVC and WebForms. I have worked with various databases including
          Microsoft SQL Server/Entity Framework, MySQL and MongoDB/Mongoose. I also attend the
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NYC-NET-Developers" target="_blank">NYC .NET Developers Group</a> and the
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nyaltnet" target="_blank">New York ALT.NET Software Development Group</a>.
