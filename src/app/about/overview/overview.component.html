          Hi! My name is <span class="name">Marvin Rusinek</span>. I am a Computer Science and Library and Information
          Sciences graduate based in Brooklyn, NY and have significant experience with front-end development and user
          experience design. I am currently seeking a full-time front-end web developer position in New York City
          working with the latest version of the <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a> framework.
          Previously I was an archivist at the <a href="https://www.ajhs.org" target="_blank">American Jewish Historical
          Society (AJHS)</a> where I worked for almost ten years processing archival collections, producing electronic
          finding aids and encoding them using XML and Encoded Archival Description (EAD). I was also the webmaster of
          the AJHS website which I maintained for seven years using front-end technologies and Drupal. My interest in
          markup languages, metadata and the Web enabled me to get interested in the web development field.
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
          I have been working with Angular for over two years. I used the AngularJS (version 1.x) of the framework for
          nine months before switching over to Angular 2. In September 2017, I attended the
          <a href="https://www.angularsummit.com" target="_blank">Angular Summit</a> in Boston which included a
          full-day training in Angular 4 and a two-day symposium. In November 2017, I attended the Open Camps in
          Manhattan which featured an intensive Angular 5 training session and then covered all the major features of
          Angular, its place in the JavaScript ecosystem, libraries that can be used with Angular and much more. Since
          then I have been learning Angular on my own by developing this website, by taking online courses in JavaScript
          and Angular on Udemy, Pluralsight and Coursera, reading JavaScript and Angular books, following Google
          Developer Experts&apos; websites, researching on StackOverflow and Googling. I am currently using Angular 7
          and enjoy learning about the latest features. I am an active joiner of the monthly
          <a href="https://www.angularnyc.com" target="_blank">AngularNYC meetup</a>,
          <a href="http://www.buzzjs.com" target="_blank">BuzzJS conferences</a> and the
          <a href="http://www.codecampnyc.org" target="_blank">Code Camp NYC</a> at Microsoft annually.

          I am very interested in software engineering and database design. I have taken graduate courses in Java
          programming with an emphasis on object-oriented software engineering practices. I also have completed
          coursework at NYU in C# with ASP.NET MVC and WebForms. I have worked with various databases such as Microsoft
          SQL Server/Entity Framework, MySQL and MongoDB/Mongoose. I also attend the
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NYC-NET-Developers" target="_blank">NYC .NET Developers Group</a> and the
          <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nyaltnet" target="_blank">New York ALT.NET Software Development Group</a>.
