Server settings

Server settings are hidden. You need to create your own server settings JSON for your own server. Server settings must follow the following format:
{ "email":{ "email": "example@gmail.com", "password": "**" }, "server":{ "host": ip / host, "user": username, "port": 22, "pass": "", "remotePath": "/path" } }

How to Run locally

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

How to Run unit tests

Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.

How to Run end-to-end tests

Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor. Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.
